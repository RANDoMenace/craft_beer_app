<h1>About</h1>
<p>This page is for the beer drinkers of the world. People who prefer quality over quantity. Because Good people drink good beer. Remember that the road less traveled is a road paved with mystery and adventure. Finally remember my friends yesterday is history, tomorrow's a mystery, but today is a gift. That is why they call it the present. Drink Good.-Skumps</p>

<h1>Where is that word from?</h1>
<p>"Skumps! Skumps! </br>
A toast to this night! </br>
The outlook is rosy, </br>
The future is bright, </br>
Our children will marry, </br>
Our kingdoms unite, </br>
Skumps! Skumps! Skumps! </br>
</br>
Skumps! Skumps! </br>
A toast to the home! </br>
One grander by far than a palace in Rome! </br>
Ah, let me fill up your glass, that last was all foam! </br>
Skumps! Skumps! Skumps!" </br>
